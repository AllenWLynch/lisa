Building DAG of jobs...
Relative file path './data/4_sort_summits.bed' starts with './'. This is redundant and strongly discouraged. It can also lead to inconsistent results of the file-matching approach used by Snakemake. You can simply omit the './' for relative file paths.
Using shell: /bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	1	all
	2	download_motifs
	2	filter_motifs
	3	format_h5
	1	get_chip_hits
	2	get_motif_hits

This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
